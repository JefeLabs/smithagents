 * separator or `..`/`.` would climb out of the instances directory, and a
 * leading `-` would be read by git as a flag rather than a value.
 *
 * Surrounding whitespace is rejected outright so the validated string remains
 * identical to the raw one, preventing "which string did you actually use" bugs.
 * Control characters are forbidden because they break git refs.
